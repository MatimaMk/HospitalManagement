## 🔧 QUICK COMMANDS

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Clear All Data
```javascript
// Run in browser console
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

## 📝 NOTES

- All data is stored in localStorage (client-side only)
- For production, need backend API + database
- File uploads limited by localStorage size (~5-10MB)
- No authentication validation (client-side only)
- Need to implement proper session management
- Consider IndexedDB for larger file storage

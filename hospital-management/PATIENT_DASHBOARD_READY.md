## üêõ Troubleshooting:

### "No data showing"
- Make sure you're logged in
- Run test data initialization
- Check localStorage in browser DevTools

### "Stats show 'None scheduled'"
- No appointments booked yet
- Book one using the modal
- Or run test data script

### "Can't book appointment"
- Make sure all fields are filled
- Date must be in future
- Time must be selected

### "Page won't load"
- Check console for errors
- Make sure dataManager.ts exists
- Rebuild: `npm run build`

---

## üìù Notes:

- All data is in localStorage (client-side only)
- Data persists across page refreshes
- Appointments must be future dates
- Files stored as Base64 (size limit ~5MB)
- For production: need backend + database
